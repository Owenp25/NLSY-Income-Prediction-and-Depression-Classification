# NLSY-Income-Prediction-and-Depression-Classification

This was a final project for a course I took in the spring of 2023. The dataset, The National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY97), is a large dataset of 8,984 participants born between 1980 and 1984. The survey first took place in 1997 where all participants were living in the United States, then interviews were held annually from 1997 until 2020. Survey participants were allowed to “skip” certain questions, and this is denoted for each question. There is data on mental health, employment, substance use, familial status, and education history. These answers are both numeric and categorical.

In this project we decided to address two main questions. First we examined the relationship between a number of predictors, such as employment, education, household & demographics and symptoms of depression (with classification with levels 0 and 1). Second, we addressed the relationship between respondent related predictors such as employment, education, household & demographics related factors and the income (continuous) of the respondents.

Attached are files with my portion of the R code, the final presentation slides, and the final report that I helped write.
